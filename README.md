# MNIST-with-NumPy-Pandas
The MNIST dataset is one of the most well-known benchmarks for testing image classification algorithms. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), where:
- 60,000 images are used for training
- 10,000 images are used for testing
Each image is 28×28 pixels in size and represents a single handwritten digit. The pixel intensity values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white), which can be normalized to the range [0, 1] for easier computation.

This project demonstrates how to load, analyze, and classify MNIST digits using only NumPy and Pandas, without relying on deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
